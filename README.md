# roadgenius.de - Website of the Road Genius quiz app for kids

This was the landing page of [roadgenius.de](http://roadgenius.de) at the finals of the CodeFEST hackathon. It has since then been replaced by a dynamically generated version.

Road Genius is an Android and iOS quiz app that makes long drives exciting for children by engaging them to explore their surroundings. The project was created at CodeFest Karlsruhe, a 48h hackathon.
